# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project, so that we understand the key decisions that have been made and why they were made.

- What should you document/communicate about your architecture?
- How should you document/communicate?

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

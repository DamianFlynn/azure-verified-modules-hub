# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the contribution guidelines for the Azure Solution project! We are excited to have you here. This document will help you get started with contributing to the OpenMined project. We are always looking for contributions from the community, so please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need help.

This document is a practical guide to help you make your first contribution to Azure Verified Solutions, enabling you to turn those additional features into reality. This guide will focus on the Bicep modules, but can also be used when contributing to the Terraform AVM modules!

## What are Azure Verified Modules?

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is a Microsoft initiative aimed at establishing a benchmark for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) standards mainly for Azure Bicep and Terraform. The modules in this repository adhere to these IaC standards and are maintained by Innofactor’s Azure practice groups.

## Contributing to AVM

The reason to contribute typically involves one of the following:

- Implementing a solution for an identified issue.
- Fixing a bug in a template.
- Adding an improvement to the existing modules.
- Adding a new module to the registry.

The AVM team has made contributions very easy. When making a contribution, you only need to write Bicep code because everything else is automated (tests, generation of documentation, etc.). For contributing to Bicep modules, the repository used will be [InnofactorOrg/Azure-Verified-Solutions](https://github.com/innofactororg/azure-verified-solutions)

### Prerequisites

Before we go to the contributing part there are some things to take into account:

- A GitHub account is required to contribute to AVM.
- Have git, Bicep CLI, and the Bicep VSCode extension installed.
- Be familiar with writing Bicep templates and using git.
- Review the contribution guidelines at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/innofactororg/azure-verified-solutions/contributing.md).

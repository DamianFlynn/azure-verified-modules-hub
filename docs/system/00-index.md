## Azure Verified Solutions

The Azure Verified Solutions platform serves as a comprehensive hub for hosting and managing Azure Verified Modules tailored for downstream organizations. This initiative is designed to centralize the customization and extension of both new and existing modules found in the Public Azure Bicep Registry. By leveraging the Azure Verified Modules, organizations can benefit from enhanced infrastructure management, all while maintaining formal architecture documentation through the use of the C4 Model. This system allows enterprises to retain control over their infrastructure as code, facilitating the publishing of customized modules to their own hosted repositories, including Azure Container Registry for Bicep and Azure Template Specs.
